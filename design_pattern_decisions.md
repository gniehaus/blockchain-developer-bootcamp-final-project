In the contract DailyDiv.sol, I have implemented 3 common design decisions and user flow. The first is importing the ERC20 token and Counters contracts from Open Zeppelin. This are both imported at the top of the script. 

The second design pattern is setting owner = msg.sender in the constructor. I use this logic in the modifer ```isOwner```, which checks to make sure the address calling functions is the address to initially created the smart contract. I also have a function ```transferOwnership```, which allows the contract owner state variable to be designated to another address. This uses the isOwner modifier.

The third design pattern is an emergency on/off switch using the state variable stopped. This variable has an initial value of false in the constructor. The modifer ```isStopped``` required the variable to be false. This modifier is used in the ```purchaseAsset```, ```payDividendAll```, ```transfer```, and ```transferOwnership``` functions. ```stopContract``` turns this variable to true and ```resumeContract``` sends this variable back to false. isOwner is required for both start/resumeContract.
